# Digital Economy and Society Visualization  

This repository hosts the code for a [website](https://reganovalisa.github.io/EU_Digital_Economy_Visualization/) visualizing the **Digital Economy and Society Dataset**.   It aims to explore how the percentage of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) correlates with ICT employment and the digital skills of the population.
Feel free to have a look!

The project leverages the official Eurostat dataset, which you can find at the following link: [Eurostat - Digital Economy and Society](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/digital-economy-and-society).
