This repository hosts the code for a website visualizing the **Digital Economy and Society Dataset**, accessible [here](https://reganovalisa.github.io/EU_Digital_Economy_Visualization/).  

The project leverages the official Eurostat dataset, which you can find at the following link: [Eurostat - Digital Economy and Society](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/digital-economy-and-society).  

Feel free to expolre it and gain some insights into the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector across Europe!
