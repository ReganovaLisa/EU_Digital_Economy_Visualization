								<h2>Economics overview</h2>
								<p>Let's explore the evolution of the ICT sector within European economies over the last decade. Which countries have successfully integrated this sector deeply into their economies, and which ones lag behind, relying more on traditional methods rather than keeping pace with modern technological advancements?</p>

								<h2>Percentage of the ICT sector in GDP</h2>
								<p>In the graph on the left, distinct groups of countries emerge. The <b style="color:darkred;">first cluster</b>, comprising Bulgaria, Estonia, and Latvia, exhibits rapid growth in the ICT sector's share within the overall GDP. The <b style="color:darkslateblue;">second group</b> , depicted in purple and consisting of Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, maintains a steady economy with a consistent average allocation of ICT resources compared to other countries. Lastly, <b style="color:chocolate;">the third cluster</b>, highlighted in yellow and encompassing Malta and Finland, undergoes significant transformations, albeit with an overall positive trend.

								<h2>Countries we analyse</h2>
								<p>The initial inclination is to examine the general parameters of countries. On this chart we connect countries to their geographical position (first column), the timing of a country's accession to the European Union (second column) and its adherence to the GDP per capita in year 2023 (third column). However, upon analyzing the alluvial graph displayed on the right, it becomes evident that there is no straightforward dependencies, indicating that simple geographical determinism is insufficient. Therefore, let's delve into the other metrics presented below for a more comprehensive understanding.</p>

								<h2>ICT personnel as part of total employment</h2>
								<p>Every technology relies on specialized support. As the ICT sector continues to expand, the average workforce in this field is also growing, as evidenced by the adjacent boxplot that depicts statistics of percentages of ICT specialists in total number of employees. We see that in countries experiencing particularly rapid growth (highlighted in red), the proportion of employees in this sector surpasses the European median.</p>

								<h2>Digital intensity in enterprises</h2>
								<p>
									The Digital Intensity Index (DII) serves as a composite indicator, formulated from surveys on ICT usage and e-commerce within enterprises. Within the framework of the Digital Decade, the DII stands as a critical performance metric. The adjacent divergent bar chart illustrates the DII across European countries, ranging from very low to very high. It's notable that a high ICT sector contribution to GDP does not invariably translate to a high DII, as evidenced by Bulgaria, for instance where despite the high sector of the industry, digital technologies are not included in most businesses.

								<h2>ICT specialists' portrait</h2>
								<p>As depicted in the piechart, the average ICT specialist, regardless of their country of origin, tends to be a male aged over 35 with more than 5 years of higher education. While it would be inaccurate to speculate on causality, the higher average age is likely linked to the longer duration of university education.</p>

								<p>Employers are actively enhancing the digital proficiency of their workforce. The graph illustrates the vertical axis representing the percentage of companies offering such training to their employees, while the horizontal axis denotes the proportion of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector in GDP. Additionally, the colors indicate the company sizeâ€” <b style="color:#F7C00F;">large</b>,<b style="color:#21908dff;">medium</b> , and <b style="color:firebrick;">small</b>.As observed, large businesses are more inclined to offer such training. Nevertheless, there appears to be no correlation with the percentage of ICT in GDP.</p>

								It appears that ICT products can have an international reach, suggesting that there's no strict requirement for demand within one's own country to foster related business development.</p>

In the Dumbell plot, countries are arranged based on the magnitude of this gap: on the left are nations where a notable disparity exists between the digital skills level of men and women (for instance, in Austria, 68% of men possess such skills compared to 60% of women), while on the right are countries where a higher proportion of women possess digital skills.</p>
